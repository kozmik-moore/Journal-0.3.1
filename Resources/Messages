[Main Window]
The Main Window is the first window that you see when you start the application for normal use. After writing your thoughts in the text box, you can press the "Save" button in the bottom button cluster or select it from the menubar to add this entry to the journal. If you have not already done so, the application will prompt you to add some tags to attach to your entry. To preempt this, you can either press the "Tags" button to open a dialog to add tags that are already in use in your journal or the "Add" button to add new tags manually. Once you have attached some tags to the entry, you can press the "Tags" button again anytime you want to attach or disattach tags, "Add" to add new tags, or the individual tag button to modify that specific tag manually.

The "Delete" button allows you to remove entries from the journal, if the entry has a date, or clear the Main Window of text and tags, if it doesn't.

"Quit" saves all changes, copies the journal to storage, and closes the application.

[Linked Entries]
Pressing the "Create Linked Entry" button will save the current entry and create a new entry, one which is linked to the entry that just closed. I link entries together based upon the thoughts that spin off in my head from reading older entries. That is how I do it, though: the context under which entries are linked together is up to you.

Once a linked entry is saved, the "Display Linked Entries" button will be enabled. Pressing this button brings up a graphical representation of your linked entries. The oldest entry in the "thought-tree" is at the bottom. As linked entries are added to this tree, it will grow upwards. Multiple disconnected thoughts emerging from the same entry will create branches, causing the tree to grow outwards.

Each node of the tree is a button representing an entry. Pressing that button will open the associated entry in the Preview Window. From that window, you can read the entry and its tags or press the "Go To Entry" button to open that entry in the Main Window for editing.

[Attachments]
The "Add Attachments" button, when pressed, allows the addition of, well, attachments. It opens a dialog prompt which allows you to navigate to and copy the attachment that you would like to associate with this entry into the journal's database. Once you have associated an attachment, the "Display Attachments" button will be selectable. Pressing this button will open a window naviagting to the location of the attachment. From there, you can manipulate the attachment using other applications on your computer.

[Date Selection]
Having acquired some journal entries, you can peruse old entries by selecting them from the drop-down box in the top left corner. The number to the left of the date tells you how many entries are currently accessible in the drop-down box. The "Filter" button will open the Date Filter Window, which lists all of the tags currently in use in the journal. Selecting or deselecting the checkbuttons will determine which entries get filtered, based on their associated tags. At the bottom of the window is a collection of buttons. The radiobuttons allow you to determine the type of filter you want:

-"OR" will allow any entry through which has, at least, one of the tags you selected;

-"AND" lets through entries that have only the tags you selected, nothing more and nothing less;

-"OR(P)" lets through the entries which have combinations of the tags selected.

The "Is Linked" button applies a filter after one of the other selected filters which sorts out the entries by whether they are linked to another entry (i.e. they are part of a thought-tree). The "ALL" button selects all checkbuttons and the "NONE" button deselects all checkbuttons. The "INVERT" button deselects all selected buttons and checks all deselected buttons.

<Welcome>
Welcome!

This is my personal journaling application.

It began as a desire to record my thoughts and experiences and turned into an attempt to record the context under which certain thoughts emerged. Specifically, I hoped to capture not only my thoughts, but the realtionship between thoughts and the overall structure of related thoughts. It is my hope, as this continues to develop, that it will be a tool to see not only the thoughts that I once possessed or currently do, but to see the change in my thoughts over time, to witness to how I change as a thinking person over the course of my life. It is my hope to also add some statistical analysis of my writing as time goes on. That is how I use this application, though: it is not how you must use it.

If you need any guidance, the "Help" menu has instructions, descriptions, keyboard shortcuts, and contact information for me.

Good writing!
